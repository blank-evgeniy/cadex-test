## Used design, SEO, and performance strategies:

- A combination of boxShadow for a glowing effect and backdropFilter: blur() for a blurring effect was used for a beautiful original design.

- Semantic markup was implemented: using tags such as h, header, footer, main, section, and article.

- Meta tags for title, description, and keywords were implemented, as well as meta tags necessary for previewing the page on social media (Open Graph, Twitter cards).

- The MUI library was used as a component library, along with MUI's built-in functionality and Emotion for CSS-in-JS.

- The react-hook-form library was used for form validation.
